# ruby-refresher

The basics of Ruby. After spending the best part of a month working with various JavaScript frameworks, this was an exercise to rehash some of the fundemental parts of ruby, before learning Rails.

# Progress

I have managed to pass all except nine of the tests. Some of the specification is too vague and test criteria are very loose. 
However I do feel that since the last time I have used Ruby I am able to write more succinct and elegant code. I now strive to get all methods down to one line.

# Getting Started

Clone the repo by pasting the following into your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/robertpulson/ruby-refresher.git`

`cd ruby-refresher` to navigate into it. Use `rspec` to check test coverage, aslong as you have rspec installed, if not use `gem install rspec`.

There is no spoon...
